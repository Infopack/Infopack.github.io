Pitch summary. 

Jannah Hossain: 
Will talk about what the product backpack is made for. Backpack is a app made to give people who are travelling a easier way to give them information about their destination for example, stores restaurants, parks and many more ! Travelling can be hard especially if they are travelling to their destination for the first time. Also elaborate more general information about the app. 

Chris Francis:
Will discuss about the features of the app that the customers will be attracted to. This will be done by listing through the table on
the features page website. When appropriate I will also describe my role in the team.
